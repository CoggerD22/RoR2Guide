# Math Verification & Validation — Mini-Project Plan

Goal: **prove every number, percentage, and formula the site uses matches Risk of
Rain 2 exactly** — no wrong values, no missing effects, no hand-waved order of
operations — and lock it so future patches can't silently break it.

This plan is grounded in the strongest sources available and is explicit about
what each step actually *proves* (verification) vs. merely checks (consistency).

---

## 1. Source hierarchy (ground truth, most authoritative first)

| # | Source | What it proves | Access |
|---|--------|----------------|--------|
| **1** | **`RoR2.dll` decompiled** — `RoR2/Risk of Rain 2_Data/Managed/RoR2.dll` (5.9 MB) | The *actual* formulas the game runs: `CharacterBody.RecalculateStats()` (exact stat order), each item's stacking constants + function, buff/proc/crit math, survivor base stats. **Definitive.** | On disk (E:). Decompile with `ilspycmd` (.NET 9 SDK is installed). |
| **2** | **In-game stat panel / logbook** | End-to-end truth: what the player actually sees for a given build. Catches anything transcription missed. | Human (you), in-game. |
| **3** | **Language files** — `StreamingAssets/Language/en/*.json` | Displayed text & the numbers embedded in it. | Already wired into `pnpm data:diff`. |
| **4** | **riskofrain2.wiki.gg** — [Item Stacking](https://riskofrain2.wiki.gg/wiki/Item_Stacking), per-item pages, stat/armor pages | Community transcription of the code. Documents the 4+ stacking categories and per-item formulas. Good cross-check, not primary. | Web. |

**Legal/ethical guardrail (non-negotiable):** decompiled game code is copyrighted.
We use it *locally for verification only*. We **never commit or redistribute the
decompiled source** — the repo continues to hold only the factual numbers/formulas
(which are facts, exactly as the wiki publishes them) plus provenance citations.
Decompiled output goes in a git-ignored directory.

---

## 2. Scope — everything numeric the site asserts

- **Item stacking** (212 items): every `base`, `perStack`, stacking **type**
  (linear / hyperbolic / exponential / **reciprocal** / special), and hard `cap`.
- **Stat-calculation engine** (Stat Lab): the exact order of operations in
  `RecalculateStats`, the armor formula (incl. **negative armor**), crit chance &
  multiplier, attack speed, movement speed, regen, jumps, shields/barrier, and
  **every** stat-affecting item (not just today's ~14).
- **Survivor stats** (19): base + per-level growth for health, regen, damage,
  armor, move speed, jumps, base attack speed, crit — including the oddballs
  (Heretic negative regen, REX HP-cost, MUL-T/Loader armor, Void Fiend forms).
- **Reference numbers**: artifact numeric effects (Glass 500%/10%, Swarms, etc.),
  shrine costs/odds, Bazaar seeding.
- **Proc coefficients** (PLAN §4.3): per-skill proc coefficients — the single most
  scattered piece of RoR2 math — extracted to a dataset.
- **The "DPS proxy"**: decide whether to make it defensible or clearly re-scope /
  remove it (it is currently an invented relative metric).

## 3. Phases

### Phase 0 — Ground-truth pipeline (tooling)
1. `dotnet tool install -g ilspycmd`; decompile `RoR2.dll` → `./.decompiled/` (git-ignored).
2. Confirm the key symbols are readable:
   - `RoR2.CharacterBody.RecalculateStats()` — the master stat method.
   - `RoR2.Items.*` / item body components + `RoR2.CharacterBody` stat fields.
   - `RoR2.CharacterMaster`, `BuffCatalog`, elite/aspect defs, `RoR2.HealthComponent`.
3. Write extraction scripts (`scripts/extract/*.ts` or `.py`) that parse the
   decompiled C# for the constants/formulas we need and emit machine-readable JSON.
4. Add `.decompiled/` to `.gitignore`. Document the decompile step so it's
   reproducible (and re-runnable after a patch).

**Proves:** we have the authoritative formulas in a diffable form.

### Phase 1 — Item stacking verification
1. Extract per-item: base value, per-stack value, stacking function, cap.
2. New tool `pnpm data:verify` diffs the extracted truth against `items.json`
   `stacking[]` (values **and** the type classification).
3. Fix every mismatch. Promote **reciprocal** to a first-class stacking type in the
   schema (today it hides inside "special"); re-tag affected items.
4. Each `stacking` entry gains a provenance note (source symbol).

**Proves:** every item's numbers and stacking behavior match the code.

### Phase 2 — Stat-calculation engine
1. Transcribe `RecalculateStats()` step-by-step: the exact sequence base → level
   scaling → additive → multiplicative → buffs, per stat.
2. Rebuild `statMath.ts` to mirror that order **exactly** (fixes the current
   combined-stacking-order approximation — the real weak point).
3. Model **all** stat-affecting items, not ~14.
4. Fix edge cases: negative-armor curve, crit base multiplier, shield/barrier,
   Transcendence, Corpsebloom cap, etc.
5. Resolve the DPS proxy: either compute a defensible number with documented
   assumptions (proc coefficients, base attack interval) or clearly present it as a
   non-authoritative relative index.

**Proves:** the calculator reproduces the game's stat math, combinations included.

### Phase 3 — Survivor stats
1. Extract base stats + growth for all 19 bodies from the decompiled body defs.
2. Diff vs `survivors.json`; fix; add non-default fields (base attack speed, base
   crit, sprint multipliers) where they differ per survivor.

**Proves:** survivor inputs to the calculator are code-accurate.

### Phase 4 — In-game empirical validation (you)
1. Define a sample matrix that exercises every stat and stacking type **and their
   combinations**: e.g. Commando@1 baseline; Merc@35 + linear items; Shaped Glass +
   Bison Steak (order interaction); crit cap; negative armor; Transcendence; a
   drone/proc build.
2. For each, you load the build in-game and read the stat panel; we reconcile the
   engine to the readings until they match to rounding.

**Proves:** end-to-end correctness against what the player actually sees — the one
check code-transcription alone can't give.

### Phase 5 — Reference & proc data
1. Verify artifact numeric effects and shrine costs/odds against the code.
2. Extract per-skill **proc coefficients** → dataset; surface in the codex/tools.

### Phase 6 — Lock-in & regression
1. `pnpm data:verify` (code-diff) + expanded `pnpm test:unit` (engine vs
   code-derived and in-game expected values). Unit tests run in CI always.
2. Every dataset number carries **provenance** (`source` + symbol) and a
   **confidence** tag: `code-verified` › `in-game-verified` › `wiki-only`.
3. Ties into PLAN §4.6 patch-survival: after a game update, re-decompile,
   re-run `data:verify`, and anything changed flips to `verified:false` until re-checked.

## 3b. Progress log

- **Phase 0 — done.** `scripts/decompile.sh` (ilspycmd 9.1.0.7988) emits
  `RecalculateStats()` etc. to `.decompiled/` (git-ignored). Committed `826cc41`.
- **Phase 2 — done for modeled stats.** Read `RecalculateStats()` block by block and
  reconciled `statMath.ts`. Most already matched the code exactly (health order,
  damage `×2^ShapedGlass` / `×5` glass, attack-speed coefficients, crit multiplier
  `2 + LaserScope`, move speed, jumps, armor). **Two real bugs fixed** (`2f29b65`):
  item regen scales with level `(1 + 0.2·(level−1))`; Irradiant Pearl also grants
  +10% crit chance/stack. Shaped Glass health confirmed to be the Curse system
  (`cursePenalty = 2^stacks` → effective HP `×0.5^n`), which the engine already did.
- **Phase 1 — partial.** `reciprocal` promoted to a first-class stacking type and 7
  items re-tagged; Light Flux's attack-speed reduction is code-confirmed reciprocal
  (`/(stacks+1)`). Committed `d07e01c`. Item *numbers* remain verified against the
  game language files (`pnpm data:diff`, 0 diffs). Non-linear formulas spot-checked
  against decompiled behavior classes: Tougher Times block = `ConvertAmp(15n)` →
  13.04%@1/60%@10 (note was already right); Safer Spaces = `15·0.9^count` (clarified);
  Genesis Loop `30/(1+n)` retagged special→reciprocal; **Old Guillotine corrected** —
  `ConvertAmp(13n)` is ~11.5%@1 stack, not the 13% amplification input the tooltip
  shows. `ConvertAmplificationPercentageIntoReductionPercentage(x) = (1−100/(100+x))·100`.
  Still TODO: Sentient Meat Hook / Tentabauble proc chances (in GlobalEventManager).
- **Phase 6 — started.** `pnpm data:verify` (`scripts/data-verify.ts`) locks the 13
  Stat Lab coefficients to the values transcribed from `RecalculateStats()` (each with
  a source-line citation) and fails CI on drift; when `.decompiled/` is present locally
  it also greps the live method for each pattern to catch post-patch changes. Still
  TODO: wire into CI, and add per-number provenance/confidence tags across the datasets.
- **Phase 3 — done, via asset extraction.** Survivor base stats are *not* in
  `RoR2.dll` (verified: `CharacterBody` declares `baseMaxHealth`/`levelRegen`/… as
  plain public fields and **no code assigns them** — they're serialized per body
  prefab). They are, however, fully extractable from the Addressables bundles.
  `scripts/extract-bodies.py` (UnityPy) reads every `CharacterBody`'s serialized
  stats in ~15s, plus the `SurvivorDef` roster. Both assets are located by **field
  signature**, not MonoScript class name, because script pointers live in separate
  `*_monoscripts_*` bundles and don't resolve.
  - Roster confirmed against the game: exactly **19 SurvivorDefs**, matching
    `survivors.json` 1:1. Notably **Operator's body is `DroneTechBody`**
    (`DRONETECH_BODY_NAME`, cachedName `DroneTech`) — proven from the SurvivorDef,
    not inferred from stat-matching.
  - **Result: 19 survivors × 10 fields = 190 comparisons, 0 mismatches.** The
    wiki-sourced values were correct — but they are now *asset-verified* rather than
    trusted. `pnpm data:verify` locks them (CI-safe table + live cross-check).
  - *Earlier this doc claimed Phase 3 was "in-game-only" because the values
    "can't be decompiled". That conclusion was untested and wrong: not-in-the-DLL
    does not mean not-extractable.*
- **Phase 4 — largely obsolete.** With formulas code-verified (Phase 2) and base
  stats asset-verified (Phase 3), every input and every operation now traces to game
  data. `docs/stat-validation.md` is retained only as an *optional* end-to-end
  spot-check; it is no longer a prerequisite for trusting the numbers.

---

## 4. Definition of done

- 100% of item stacking values + types **code-verified** (`data:verify` clean).
- `statMath` order of operations provably mirrors `RecalculateStats`.
- All 19 survivors' stats code-verified.
- The in-game sample matrix matches the engine to rounding.
- Artifacts/shrines numeric data code-verified; proc-coefficient dataset exists.
- Regression automation in place; every number is provenance-tagged.

## 5. Risks & constraints

- **Copyright:** decompiled source stays local & git-ignored; only facts are committed.
- **Decompilation quality:** RoR2 isn't heavily obfuscated, but some values live in
  Unity asset bundles (prefab component fields) rather than C# constants — those may
  need a secondary extraction path (AssetRipper / in-game readout) and are the most
  likely to fall back to Phase 4.
- **Effort:** multi-session. Phases 0–1 are the backbone; 2–4 are the depth.
- **Patch drift:** the whole pipeline is re-runnable so a new patch is an afternoon,
  not a rebuild.

## 6. Suggested sequencing

`Phase 0` → `Phase 1` (biggest correctness win) → `Phase 3` (cheap, feeds the engine)
→ `Phase 2` (rebuild engine to code) → `Phase 4` (empirical lock) → `Phase 5` → `Phase 6`.
